#1 Added Epsilon Object
  - namespace used is 'el'
  - not compeleted.
  - still have to workout ways to update field data.
  - project file is of CodeLite IDE (linux environment).

 #2 Added Database Object
  - CDatabase & CSVRow class implementation.
  - LoadIntoTheMap pending.
  
 #3 Added new Epsilon Object - Currency and InterestRate.
  - For InterestRate currently loading only around 5 fields. We would need more fields later.
  - Fields value setting from CSVRow is done except for Date field (yet to decide how to store date).
  - main.cpp changed to EpsilonObjectMain.cpp. This is done so that there can be other similar main file could reside in the same folder.r
  
  #4 Added Rule class
  - Added CRule base class.
  - Currently added only BalanceBookRule will add rest of the rules also.
